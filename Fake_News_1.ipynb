According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

He met with representatives from the coal industry to sign a bill undoing Obama s coal mining rule. The people s president is a worker!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SCOTT PRUITT S APPOINTMENT TO EPA CHIEF THE LEFT WENT BONKERS!OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOTT PRUITT is another perfect choice from President-elect Donald Trump. He s sued the feds several times for their overreach in regulations on the coal industry. You have to love his commitment to keeping the federal government on the straight and narrow. It s funny that so many of Trump s picks have gone against Obama s policies We love it! The lefty politicians in DC wasted no time tweeted out their displeasure:When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing\",\n          \" (In this Oct. 13 story, corrects description of legal standard regarding Trump in paragraph 15) By Alison Frankel and Dan Levine (Reuters) - Donald Trump hasn\\u2019t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  A lawyer for the New York real estate developer demanded on Wednesday The New York Times retract a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriately touching them. If the newspaper did not comply, Trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would \\u201cpursue all available actions and remedies,\\u201d the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in a letter.  Trump said at a rally on Thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  An attorney for the Times, David McCraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would \\u201cwelcome the opportunity\\u201d to defend it in court. Over the years, media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Village Voice, the New York Post and Fortune Magazine have reported receiving similar threats from Trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. However, Trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a Reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service Westlaw, a unit of Thomson Reuters.   \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. Trump filed the case after the Chicago Tribune\\u2019s architecture critic called his proposed 150-story Manhattan skyscraper an \\u201catrocious, ugly monstrosity.\\u201d In 1985, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a First Amendment right to express his opinion. The skyscraper was never built. In the 32 years since Trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. He was successful in one of those cases.  Book author and former New York Times reporter Timothy O\\u2019Brien defeated a Trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after Trump underwent a grueling deposition by O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s lawyers.  Trump\\u2019s suit against O\\u2019Brien, which also named O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s publisher, Time Warner Book Group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman\\u2019s net worth. A New Jersey state judge found in 2009 that Trump had not established O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s actual malice. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Former Miss Universe contestant Sheena Monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which Trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as \\u201crigged.\\u201d The arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in Manhattan in 2013. The court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The same year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tarla Makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against Trump University, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the Better Business Bureau that Trump University engaged in fraudulent business practices. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, dismissed Trump\\u2019s defamation claim. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Trump\\u2019s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the Reuters docket search may have missed. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0U.S. courts have routinely deemed Trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. That means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d for the truth. If Trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. The New York Times attorney, David McCraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. Any Trump claim will be difficult because Trump\\u2019s accusers were on the record, said Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at University of Minnesota Law School. That would bolster the newspaper\\u2019s argument that it didn\\u2019t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. Trump has vowed to \\u201copen up our libel laws,\\u201d if he wins the presidency on Nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. In reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. Court records show that Trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. Most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a Trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a Trump casino in Indiana, were dismissed. One defamation suit against Trump survived dismissal, however. Stock analyst Marvin Roffman sued Trump for $2 million in federal court in Philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. Roffman alleged Trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. After a federal judge refused to toss the case, the Trump Organization settled in 1991. An attorney for Roffman declined to comment. \",\n          \"MOSCOW (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that London could not ignore Russia s meddling in elections around the world, its actions in Ukraine, or the persecution of gay people in Chechnya.

General Assembly. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will dramatically expand the Papah\\u0101naumoku\\u0101kea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii on Friday, the White House said, an action that will ban commercial fishing from more than 582,500 sq miles (1.5 million sq km) of the Pacific Ocean. Obama will visit the protected area on Sept. 1 to draw attention to the threat that climate change poses to oceans, traveling to Midway Atoll - a remote coral reef that was the site of a pivotal World War Two battle and is now known for its sea turtles, monk seals, and millions of seabirds. Obama, who was born in Hawaii and spent most of his childhood there, made curbing climate change a central part of his time in the White House, which draws to a close on Jan. 20. Some of his efforts have been blocked by Congress or held up in court challenges. But preserving public space from development has been something Obama can do using his own power, and he had moved to permanently protect more than 265 million acres of land and water even before the expansion in Hawaii. Obama has also sought to use the star power of his office to raise public concern about climate issues. Trailed by camera crews, he has hiked on an Alaska glacier and walked through the Florida Everglades. His journey to Midway Atoll, a former naval base that is now a rarely visited refuge, is aimed at sending a hopeful message. \\u201cThe best science shows that the ocean can recover, if you allow it to,\\u201d said Senator Brian Schatz, who worked with scientists, environmental groups and native Hawaiians to urge Obama to expand the monument. \\u201cAs daunting as the problem of climate change is, and as troubling as the situation is with respect to our oceans, they show remarkable resilience, if you give them a chance,\\u201d Schatz told Reuters. The monument was first established 10 years ago by former Republican President George W. Bush, who created the world\\u2019s largest marine reserve at the time, protecting close to 140,000 sq miles of ocean around the Hawaiian archipelago and inspiring a series of similar projects around the world. The four-fold boost in territory will cover an area with more than 7,000 marine species, including a coral that is the world\\u2019s oldest-known living organism at 4,265 years old. \\u201cWe think of Papah\\u0101naumoku\\u0101kea\\u2019s original designation as a catalyst, and we\\u2019re hoping it will be again,\\u201d said Seth Horstmeyer, a director with Pew\\u2019s Global Ocean Legacy project. Only about 3 percent of the world\\u2019s oceans have similar protections, according to Pew. Obama is set on Wednesday to address leaders of Pacific islands and a global conference of conservation officials and environmental groups in Honolulu. \\u201cWe would like the other nations to follow suit,\\u201d said Sol Kaho\\u2019ohalahala, a seventh-generation native Hawaiian. In an interview, Kaho\\u2019ohalahala explained that Papah\\u0101naumoku\\u0101kea, considered a sacred place, figures large in the creation myths of his people. \\u201cWe are part of this place, we\\u2019re not the beginning of this place,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOur responsibility is really as a people now how to care for this place.\\u201d Some Hawaiians had argued against the expansion. Longline commercial fishermen, who have been praised for sustainable fishing, have counted on the area for an estimated 3 to 13 percent of their annual catch of tuna, which is limited under quotas and governed by extensive conservation measures. \\u201cExcluding American citizens from American waters and forcing in this case fishermen onto the high seas to do their business - something just doesn\\u2019t quite sit right,\\u201d said Sean Martin, president of the Hawaii Longline Association, explaining the expansion could raise his costs. But Hawaiian Senator Schatz, who worked on a compromise plan to accommodate certain types of fishing and more Native Hawaiian involvement in managing the preserve, said there would be plenty of fish left for longline fishermen in other areas. \\u201cThey will have very little difficulty fishing up to the limit under the tuna treaty, even with the new boundaries,\\u201d Schatz said. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate subcommittee on children and families wants a congressional watchdog agency to investigate whether states are complying with a federal law meant to protect newborns in drug withdrawal and help their families. In a letter sent this week to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Senator Robert Casey of Pennsylvania asked that the probe examine what steps Congress or the Obama Administration could take \\u201cto improve compliance and save the lives of vulnerable infants.\\u201d The request comes in response to a Reuters investigation in December that identified the preventable deaths of 110 babies whose mothers used opioids during pregnancy and were subsequently sent home to families ill-equipped to care for them. A 2003 federal law calls on states to require that healthcare workers notify child protection services when a baby is born affected by illegal substance abuse or has symptoms of drug withdrawal. Such reports are not to be used as evidence of abuse, the law says, but rather to help develop a \\u201cplan of safe care\\u201d for the newborns after they leave the hospital. Reuters found that no more than nine states and the District of Columbia appear to follow the law. Even so, no state had lost federal funding from failing to abide by the provision. More than 27,000 newborns in the United States were diagnosed with drug withdrawal syndrome in 2013 \\u2013 five times the number diagnosed with the condition in 2003. \\u201cReuters\\u2019 groundbreaking report on the condition of children born with opioid dependencies should be a call to action for all members of Congress,\\u201d Casey said in a separate statement. Cathleen Palm, executive director of the Center for Children\\u2019s Justice, a Pennsylvania non-profit advocacy group, supported Casey\\u2019s action.\\u00a0 \\u201cBy GAO and Congress saying we want states to tangibly tell us what they are doing, it\\u2019s going to force them to really look at it,\\u201d Palm said. \\u201cIt just feels like we\\u2019re about to get a whole lot more motivated about these babies and their families.\\u201d Mark Weber, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees compliance with the law, said the agency will \\u201cwork with the GAO when an inquiry is made.\\u201d The Reuters investigation, \\u201cHelpless & Hooked,\\u201d can be found at reut.rs/1NSc7uC \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

if you know how much money is spent that americans will be even more outraged by the thousands of mostly muslim refugees being shipped in quietly to america if you re not familiar with the refugee resettlement scam that costs billions  the information below  from judicial watch will shock you  the information is being hidden redacted by the state department because they don t want americans to know what they give to the  resettlement agencies per year  it s mind blowing  here s just one example  the state department paid a volag called united states conference of catholic bishops  usccb  a ghastly     in one year to resettle refugees that came mostly from muslim countries  please listen to ann corcoran in the video below state dept  hides big chunks of    mil contract to resettle muslim refugeesthe u s  government spends billions of dollars to  resettle  foreign nationals and transparency on how the money is spent depends on the agency involved  judicial watch has been investigating it for years  specifically the huge amount of taxpayer dollars that go to  voluntary agencies   known as volags  to provide a wide range of services for the new arrivals  throughout the ongoing probe judicial watch has found a striking difference on how government lawyers use an exemption  officially known as  b     to the freedom of information act  foia  to withhold records  all the cases involve public funds being used to resettle foreigners on u s  soil and americans should be entitled to the records the  b    exemption permits agencies to withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person which is privileged or confidential  depending on the government agency and the mood of the taxpayer funded lawyers handling public records requests  that information is exempt from disclosure  in these cases  the department of health and human services  hhs  disclosed a volag contract to resettle tens of thousands of unaccompanied alien children  uac  that entered the u s  through mexico under the obama administration while the state department withheld large portions of a one year     million deal to resettle refugees from muslim countries  most of the uacs came from el salvador  honduras and guatemala and the obama administration blamed the sudden surge on violence in the three central american nations  the agency responsible for resettling the minors and issuing contracts for the costly services is hhs as a result of judicial watch s work hhs furnished records with virtually nothing redacted  disclosed were employee salaries of volags contracted by the agency to provide services for the illegal immigrant minors  the cost of laptops  big screen tvs  food  pregnancy tests   multicultural crayons  and shower stalls for the new arrivals  the general contract was to provide  basic shelter care  for   minors for a period of four months in   this cost american taxpayers an astounding     and the volag contracted to do it was government regular called baptist children and family services  bcfs   the breakdown includes charges of     for uacs at fort sill  oklahoma and an additional     for uacs at lackland air force base in san antonio  texas hhs rightfully provided all sorts of details in the records  including the cost of emergency surge beds       for just four months  food for the illegal alien minors and staff        medical supplies such as first aid kits  latex gloves  lice shampoo and pregnancy tests        recreation items such as board games  soccer balls and jump ropes       educational items like art paper and multicultural crayons       laptops      and cellphones       hotel accommodations for the bcfs staff was      the records show  and the salary for a  member  incident management team  was      which breaks down to    per imt member for the four month period  it was outrageous that the obama administration spent nearly   million of taxpayer funds to provide illegal alien children with the types of extravagant high tech equipment and lavish benefits many american families cannot even afford for their own children this has become a heated issue for the government which may explain why other agencies aren t as forthcoming in providing specific figures  thus abusing the  b    exemption  the state department  for instance  redacted huge portions of records involving contracts with volags to resettle refugees from mostly muslim countries  the files illustrate the disparate redaction treatment given by different government agencies to the same types of records  the state department paid a volag called united states conference of catholic bishops  usccb  a ghastly     in one year to resettle refugees that came mostly from muslim countries  unlike hhs  the agency redacted information related to what the usccb charged the government for things like furniture  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with contracts to resettle refugees  why did one government agency hand over the same types of records that another agency claims are trade secrets  judicial watch is challenging the state department s  b    exemption and will provide updates as they become available hhs and the state department work with nine volags to resettle refugees and the voluntary agencies have hundreds of contractors they like to call  affiliates   it s a huge racket that costs american taxpayers monstrous sums and judicial watch is working to pinpoint the exact amount  besides bcfs and usccb  other volags with lucrative government gigs to resettle refugees are  church world service  ethiopian community development council  episcopal migration ministries  hebrew immigrant aid society  international rescue committee  u s  committee for refugees and immigrants  lutheran immigration refugee services and world relief corporation via  judicial watch\",\n          \"london  reuters    brexit could be reversed if economic pain prompts a change in public opinion that brings a new generation of political leaders to power in britain  former conservative minister michael heseltine said  heseltine  who helped topple margaret thatcher in  but ultimately failed to win the top job  said that britain could face another election in just two years and that prime minister theresa may would not lead the party into that election  a supporter of eu membership  heseltine said he saw a scenario in which britain would not leave the european union as scheduled in late march     there is now a possibility that brexit will not happen  but it will need a change in public opinion   heseltine    told reuters in an interview   there may be indications but there is no really substantive evidence of public opinion moving but i think that it will happen  my guess is that public opinion will move   he said  heseltine said the shift in brexit policy by the opposition labour party   including staying in the european single market and customs union for a transitional period   indicated labour had sensed the wind of a change in public opinion  may  who quietly opposed brexit ahead of the referendum  has formally notified the bloc of britain s intention to leave and divorce talks are under way  some european leaders have suggested britain could change its mind  while former conservative prime minister john major has said there is a credible case for giving britons a second vote on the brexit deal  his successor  labour s tony blair  has said repeatedly that brexit can and should be stopped  in the june  referendum voters in the united kingdom backed leaving the eu by a margin of   percent to   percent  the world s fifth biggest economy initially withstood the shock of the brexit vote  but growth began to slow sharply this year as inflation rose on the falling value of the pound and hit households  may  who has insisted that britain will leave the european union  said last month that she wanted to fight the next parliamentary election  not due until   heseltine  though  said that seemed unlikely given her botched gamble on a snap election in june which lost her party its majority in the lower house of parliament   i don t think she will fight the next election  but there is no agreement on her successor  all the people indicated as possibles are singing the same song  and in my view the song is unattractive and will become less attractive   he said   ousted  is a specific word  but there are many ways in which the tory party operates   what it will quite look like i am not going to say  but i think there will be a change to a new leader before the next election    they have two years before the next election   heseltine said he was waiting for a politician to emerge with the courage to challenge the brexit consensus of british politics and explain to voters the full import of the divorce   within a relatively short period of time  the brexit negotiations will sour even more than they already have  and the tories will be left holding the baby  everybody else will have moved away from brexit   heseltine said  brexit  he said  was a  monumental mistake  that would make britain a spectator of  century history  bleed its wealth and relegate it from the league of leading global powers   the idea that we are not european is just to spit in the wind  anyone who has read shakespeare knows just how european we are   said heseltine  who the sunday times says has a fortune of  million pounds    million   he said brexit was far more significant than the  suez crisis  when british forces were forced by the united states to withdraw troops from egypt in a blunt illustration of britain s lost imperial power  heseltine said the eu was unlikely to give britain the beneficial divorce deal it wanted because to do so would risk unraveling the eu itself   it is difficult to see how the brexit negotiations can be anything other than discordant  the issues are huge and they come down to a very simple question  can the europeans agree to someone leaving the club on  the cake and eat it  basis     i don t think they can  and they have made it clear they don t intend to  if they were to change their mind so that we have our cake and eat it  well of course i will be wrong  but i don t think they are going to do that    \",\n          \"washington  reuters    members of the u s  house intelligence committee on thursday interviewed the head of a data analysis firm to determine whether donald trump s election campaign team sought his help to find thousands of emails missing from hillary clinton s private server  three sources familiar with the session said  trump s campaign hired alexander nix and the company  cambridge analytica  in june  and paid it more than    million through last december  according to federal election commission records  the month after his firm was hired  nix emailed wikileaks founder julian assange for help tracking down some   emails that clinton supposedly had deleted from her private server  the daily beast and the wall street journal reported in october  nix wanted to convert the missing and potentially damaging emails into a searchable database for use by the trump campaign or a pro trump political action committee  the journal reported   wikileaks confirmed to reuters on thursday that it was approached by nix  but a representative said it turned down his request      the intelligence committee is investigating possible collusion between trump s campaign team and russia during the  election  the matter is also being investigated by special counsel robert mueller and three other congressional committees  russia has denied meddling in the election  and trump has said there was no collusion between moscow and his campaign    representatives elijah cummings and jerrold nadler  the top democrats on the house oversight and judiciary committees  on thursday asked their republican committee chairmen to issue subpoenas for documents from cambridge analytica and giles parscale  another data analysis firm that worked for the trump campaign  spokesmen for cambridge analytica and giles parscale did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment           cummings and nadler said they sent their letter after the two companies declined to answer questions about whether they had contacts with foreign actors during the  presidential campaign  the sources said the intelligence committee members met at a washington law office on thursday to conduct the interview with nix by skype because he was not in the united states  the sources said the interview lasted some  minutes  the cia  federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency said in january that russia used propaganda  social media and other means to meddle in the  election to try to help trump defeat clinton          in their report  the agencies said russian intelligence services hacked emails and other documents from the democratic national committee and other democratic party organizations  and used wikileaks to release them   \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

if you know how much money is spent that americans will be even more outraged by the thousands of mostly muslim refugees being shipped in quietly to america if you re not familiar with the refugee resettlement scam that costs billions  the information below  from judicial watch will shock you  the information is being hidden redacted by the state department because they don t want americans to know what they give to the  resettlement agencies per year  it s mind blowing  here s just one example  the state department paid a volag called united states conference of catholic bishops  usccb  a ghastly     in one year to resettle refugees that came mostly from muslim countries  please listen to ann corcoran in the video below state dept  hides big chunks of    mil contract to resettle muslim refugeesthe u s  government spends billions of dollars to  resettle  foreign nationals and transparency on how the money is spent depends on the agency involved  judicial watch has been investigating it for years  specifically the huge amount of taxpayer dollars that go to  voluntary agencies   known as volags  to provide a wide range of services for the new arrivals  throughout the ongoing probe judicial watch has found a striking difference on how government lawyers use an exemption  officially known as  b     to the freedom of information act  foia  to withhold records  all the cases involve public funds being used to resettle foreigners on u s  soil and americans should be entitled to the records the  b    exemption permits agencies to withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person which is privileged or confidential  depending on the government agency and the mood of the taxpayer funded lawyers handling public records requests  that information is exempt from disclosure  in these cases  the department of health and human services  hhs  disclosed a volag contract to resettle tens of thousands of unaccompanied alien children  uac  that entered the u s  through mexico under the obama administration while the state department withheld large portions of a one year     million deal to resettle refugees from muslim countries  most of the uacs came from el salvador  honduras and guatemala and the obama administration blamed the sudden surge on violence in the three central american nations  the agency responsible for resettling the minors and issuing contracts for the costly services is hhs as a result of judicial watch s work hhs furnished records with virtually nothing redacted  disclosed were employee salaries of volags contracted by the agency to provide services for the illegal immigrant minors  the cost of laptops  big screen tvs  food  pregnancy tests   multicultural crayons  and shower stalls for the new arrivals  the general contract was to provide  basic shelter care  for   minors for a period of four months in   this cost american taxpayers an astounding     and the volag contracted to do it was government regular called baptist children and family services  bcfs   the breakdown includes charges of     for uacs at fort sill  oklahoma and an additional     for uacs at lackland air force base in san antonio  texas hhs rightfully provided all sorts of details in the records  including the cost of emergency surge beds       for just four months  food for the illegal alien minors and staff        medical supplies such as first aid kits  latex gloves  lice shampoo and pregnancy tests        recreation items such as board games  soccer balls and jump ropes       educational items like art paper and multicultural crayons       laptops      and cellphones       hotel accommodations for the bcfs staff was      the records show  and the salary for a  member  incident management team  was      which breaks down to    per imt member for the four month period  it was outrageous that the obama administration spent nearly   million of taxpayer funds to provide illegal alien children with the types of extravagant high tech equipment and lavish benefits many american families cannot even afford for their own children this has become a heated issue for the government which may explain why other agencies aren t as forthcoming in providing specific figures  thus abusing the  b    exemption  the state department  for instance  redacted huge portions of records involving contracts with volags to resettle refugees from mostly muslim countries  the files illustrate the disparate redaction treatment given by different government agencies to the same types of records  the state department paid a volag called united states conference of catholic bishops  usccb  a ghastly     in one year to resettle refugees that came mostly from muslim countries  unlike hhs  the agency redacted information related to what the usccb charged the government for things like furniture  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with contracts to resettle refugees  why did one government agency hand over the same types of records that another agency claims are trade secrets  judicial watch is challenging the state department s  b    exemption and will provide updates as they become available hhs and the state department work with nine volags to resettle refugees and the voluntary agencies have hundreds of contractors they like to call  affiliates   it s a huge racket that costs american taxpayers monstrous sums and judicial watch is working to pinpoint the exact amount  besides bcfs and usccb  other volags with lucrative government gigs to resettle refugees are  church world service  ethiopian community development council  episcopal migration ministries  hebrew immigrant aid society  international rescue committee  u s  committee for refugees and immigrants  lutheran immigration refugee services and world relief corporation via  judicial watch\",\n          \"london  reuters    brexit could be reversed if economic pain prompts a change in public opinion that brings a new generation of political leaders to power in britain  former conservative minister michael heseltine said  heseltine  who helped topple margaret thatcher in  but ultimately failed to win the top job  said that britain could face another election in just two years and that prime minister theresa may would not lead the party into that election  a supporter of eu membership  heseltine said he saw a scenario in which britain would not leave the european union as scheduled in late march     there is now a possibility that brexit will not happen  but it will need a change in public opinion   heseltine    told reuters in an interview   there may be indications but there is no really substantive evidence of public opinion moving but i think that it will happen  my guess is that public opinion will move   he said  heseltine said the shift in brexit policy by the opposition labour party   including staying in the european single market and customs union for a transitional period   indicated labour had sensed the wind of a change in public opinion  may  who quietly opposed brexit ahead of the referendum  has formally notified the bloc of britain s intention to leave and divorce talks are under way  some european leaders have suggested britain could change its mind  while former conservative prime minister john major has said there is a credible case for giving britons a second vote on the brexit deal  his successor  labour s tony blair  has said repeatedly that brexit can and should be stopped  in the june  referendum voters in the united kingdom backed leaving the eu by a margin of   percent to   percent  the world s fifth biggest economy initially withstood the shock of the brexit vote  but growth began to slow sharply this year as inflation rose on the falling value of the pound and hit households  may  who has insisted that britain will leave the european union  said last month that she wanted to fight the next parliamentary election  not due until   heseltine  though  said that seemed unlikely given her botched gamble on a snap election in june which lost her party its majority in the lower house of parliament   i don t think she will fight the next election  but there is no agreement on her successor  all the people indicated as possibles are singing the same song  and in my view the song is unattractive and will become less attractive   he said   ousted  is a specific word  but there are many ways in which the tory party operates   what it will quite look like i am not going to say  but i think there will be a change to a new leader before the next election    they have two years before the next election   heseltine said he was waiting for a politician to emerge with the courage to challenge the brexit consensus of british politics and explain to voters the full import of the divorce   within a relatively short period of time  the brexit negotiations will sour even more than they already have  and the tories will be left holding the baby  everybody else will have moved away from brexit   heseltine said  brexit  he said  was a  monumental mistake  that would make britain a spectator of  century history  bleed its wealth and relegate it from the league of leading global powers   the idea that we are not european is just to spit in the wind  anyone who has read shakespeare knows just how european we are   said heseltine  who the sunday times says has a fortune of  million pounds    million   he said brexit was far more significant than the  suez crisis  when british forces were forced by the united states to withdraw troops from egypt in a blunt illustration of britain s lost imperial power  heseltine said the eu was unlikely to give britain the beneficial divorce deal it wanted because to do so would risk unraveling the eu itself   it is difficult to see how the brexit negotiations can be anything other than discordant  the issues are huge and they come down to a very simple question  can the europeans agree to someone leaving the club on  the cake and eat it  basis     i don t think they can  and they have made it clear they don t intend to  if they were to change their mind so that we have our cake and eat it  well of course i will be wrong  but i don t think they are going to do that    \",\n          \"washington  reuters    members of the u s  house intelligence committee on thursday interviewed the head of a data analysis firm to determine whether donald trump s election campaign team sought his help to find thousands of emails missing from hillary clinton s private server  three sources familiar with the session said  trump s campaign hired alexander nix and the company  cambridge analytica  in june  and paid it more than    million through last december  according to federal election commission records  the month after his firm was hired  nix emailed wikileaks founder julian assange for help tracking down some   emails that clinton supposedly had deleted from her private server  the daily beast and the wall street journal reported in october  nix wanted to convert the missing and potentially damaging emails into a searchable database for use by the trump campaign or a pro trump political action committee  the journal reported   wikileaks confirmed to reuters on thursday that it was approached by nix  but a representative said it turned down his request      the intelligence committee is investigating possible collusion between trump s campaign team and russia during the  election  the matter is also being investigated by special counsel robert mueller and three other congressional committees  russia has denied meddling in the election  and trump has said there was no collusion between moscow and his campaign    representatives elijah cummings and jerrold nadler  the top democrats on the house oversight and judiciary committees  on thursday asked their republican committee chairmen to issue subpoenas for documents from cambridge analytica and giles parscale  another data analysis firm that worked for the trump campaign  spokesmen for cambridge analytica and giles parscale did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment           cummings and nadler said they sent their letter after the two companies declined to answer questions about whether they had contacts with foreign actors during the  presidential campaign  the sources said the intelligence committee members met at a washington law office on thursday to conduct the interview with nix by skype because he was not in the united states  the sources said the interview lasted some  minutes  the cia  federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency said in january that russia used propaganda  social media and other means to meddle in the  election to try to help trump defeat clinton          in their report  the agencies said russian intelligence services hacked emails and other documents from the

            "In December 2015, world leaders reached a historic agreement in Paris at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21), aimed at combating climate change. The Paris Agreement, as it is now known, was signed by 195 countries and sets a framework for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of striving to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The agreement was hailed as a major step forward in the fight against climate change, as it marked the first time that nearly every nation on Earth pledged to take action to reduce emissions. The accord calls for each country to set its own national targets for reducing emissions, with regular reviews to ensure progress is being made.  One of the key features of the Paris Agreement is the emphasis on a global cooperative effort, with both developed and developing nations contributing to climate action. Richer countries have committed to providing financial support to poorer nations to help them mitigate the effects of climate change and transition to cleaner energy sources.  The agreement also includes mechanisms for tracking and reporting progress, ensuring that nations are held accountable for their commitments. While the deal is non-binding, the political will and commitment behind the agreement make it a significant milestone in the global effort to tackle climate change.  Following the agreement, many leaders, environmentalists, and scientists expressed optimism that the Paris Climate Agreement would pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future, while also addressing the urgent need to protect the planet for future generations.\n",
